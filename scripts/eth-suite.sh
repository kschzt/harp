# §8.7 Ethernet/IP conformance SUITE — the single OS-matrix entry point.
#
# eth.yml runs this once per OS (ubuntu / macos / windows) AFTER a per-OS build. It is
# the one source of truth for WHICH conformance scripts run, so the test set can no
# longer drift between platforms (the old eth.yml-vs-win.yml split silently ran 5 of
# ~10 scripts on Windows). A test runs on EVERY platform by default; a skip is an
# explicit, logged, capability- or OS-gated decision — never a silent omission.
#
# Gating model (capability-based, so coverage auto-expands as binaries appear):
#   - DEVICED / HOSTBIN / VHOST / CHOST are located per-OS (env override wins) and
#     exported, so each sub-script finds its binaries without per-OS edits here.
#   - PROBE-dependent scripts (recall, offline-edit, device-side diag-bundle) run iff
#     harp-probe is built; on a platform that doesn't build it yet they SKIP (and will
#     auto-enable the moment that platform starts building harp-probe — no edit here).
#   - The per-OS strictness inside each script (loopback ±1ms on Linux / wiring-only
#     elsewhere; the bit-exact macOS/Windows retry+relaxed RMS floor) is unchanged —
#     this suite only orchestrates, it does not relax anything.
#
# DRY_RUN=1 prints the located binaries + the run/skip plan for this host and exits 0
# (used by local validation before pushing — the real multi-OS proof is the PR matrix).
